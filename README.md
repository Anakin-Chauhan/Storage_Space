# Storage_Space
Developed a storage space detection model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 

A model to detect a potential physical storage space. Dataset includes images of common storage furniture at home ex.- cupboards, wardrobes, shelfs, etc. and similar looking confusing images of doors and obvious non storage spaces like walls. Trained many models with different architecture. Also experimented with maxpooling. Results can be seen in code file itself. Model can be further trained with industrial images too. This model have application in household and industrial AI assistant, warehouse management, inventory managemnet AI, etc.
